# Novel Navigator

## Description

The Novel Navigator is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API and save their favorite selections. Originally built with a RESTful API, this project has been refactored to use GraphQL with Apollo Server for improved performance and flexibility.

This MERN stack application features a React front end, a MongoDB database, and an Express.js/Node.js backend. Users can create an account, log in, search for books, save books to their profile, and remove saved books. Authentication is handled with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and integrated into the GraphQL API.

The application is deployed on Render, with MongoDB hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
